# FitReal
FitReal is an iOS app that revolutionises the idea of sharing and talking about fitness. FitReal is a massive implementation project with multiple upcoming features as well.

Essentially, FitReal allows you to configure a period when you are working out. During that period, you are sent a notification to snap yourself and your dumbbells and share with your friends! üí™

**Here's a [Video Demo](https://github.com/Prakhar896/FitReal/blob/main/fitreal_demo%20-%20Made%20with%20Clipchamp.mp4)**

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI
- Firebase
  - Authentication
  - Storage
  - Realtime Database
- UserNotifications
- Combine


Future features we would like to incorporate (but couldn't because of some time constraints:
- Social features: Commenting, liking etc.
- Strava Developer API Integration
- A new tab with a Gen AI conversational model that suggests workout routines to the user
- Support for more complex workout routines

And that's FitReal! Thanks for checking it out!
