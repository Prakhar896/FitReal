# FitReal
**This app was built for the NYP Code Overflow Hackathon 2023 and we clinched second place! üéâüéâ**

FitReal is an iOS app that revolutionises the idea of sharing and talking about fitness. FitReal is a quite a big project with various multiple parts as well as multiple upcoming features.

Essentially, FitReal allows you to configure a period when you are working out. During that period, you are sent a notification to snap yourself and your dumbbells and share with your friends! üí™

FitReal aims to not only encourage, but further promote conversation, sharing and the socialization of all aspects of fitness and healthy living; from posting a FitReal when at the gym to posting one during a run at a park, the app re-defines what it means to share a passion that many don't expect others to have as well.
